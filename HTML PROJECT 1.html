				<h2>
Positive relationships are essential for young people's mental health at school. By prioritizing relationship-building and using coaching-based approaches behaviour issues are not only reduced, but interactions that facilitate wellbeing are built.

Well-being is important at school because schools have an essential role to play in supporting students to make healthy lifestyle choices and understand the effects of their choices on their health and well-being. 

Childhood and adolescence is a critical period in the development of long-term attitudes towards personal well-being and lifestyle choices. The social and emotional skills, knowledge and behaviours that young people learn in the classroom help them build resilience and set the pattern for how they will manage their physical and mental health throughout their lives.

By building a culture of inclusivity and support in classrooms, encouraging participation in school activities, and prioritizing relationship-building, students can feel more connected, resilient, and capable of achieving their goals. With this foundation of positive relationships, young people will be better equipped to face the challenges of life with confidence and optimism.
